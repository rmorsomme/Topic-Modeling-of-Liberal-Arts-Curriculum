Introduction
============

University departments often have little knowledge of the content of their study programs. Yet, having a good understanding of what each course of a program covers is paramount to offering an education of quality.

In this script, I analyze the content of the curriculum of the University College Maastricht (UCM), Maastricht University, the Netherlands. UCM offers a bachelor in Liberal Arts and Science. Its curriculum contains over two hundred courses on virtually every topic conceivable - ranging from artificial intelligence to Shakespeare, and terrorism - making it a great subject for this type of analysis.

To accomplish this, I analyze the 200-page course catalogue of UCM where each course possesses a description of one or two pages. The analysis is exploratory in nature: instead of answering a specific research question, I explore the textual data to obtain a better understanding of the content of UCM's curriculum. I conduct three analyses. First, I identify the key words of each course with the tf-idf. Second, I compare the evolution of the catalogues over time to identify themes that have emerged and declined. Finally, I fit a topic model on the most recent course catalogue (2018-2019). For this purpose, I use the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm. The reader can use the [Shiny App](https://rmorsomme.shinyapps.io/shiny_app/) to visualize the results of these analyses.

Data preparation
================

Overview
--------

We starting by importing the course catalogues and a data set containing information at the course level. We then extract the descriptions of each course from the course catalogues. These descriptions are one to two pages long and form the textual data that we will analyze. Lastly, we transform the data into the *[tidy text format](https://www.tidytextmining.com/tidytext.html)*, stem the terms and remove the stop-words.

Importing
---------

We import two datasets: `corpus`, a corpus containing the five most recent course catalogues of UCM, and `d_course`, a tiblle indicating the code, name and cluster of each course (ourses are distributed among 17 clusters: International Relation, Cultural Studies, Biomedical Science, etc.).

``` r
corpus <- Corpus(
  x             = DirSource("Catalogues"),
  readerControl = list(reader = readPDF(control = list(text = "-layout")))
  )
```

``` r
d_course <- read_csv(
  file = "Course.csv",
  col_type = cols()
  )
```

Extracting course descriptions from course catalogues
-----------------------------------------------------

We extract the description of each course from the course catalogues. Since the code is a little longish (see appendix) and does not add much to the script, I only show its outcome.

``` r
print(d_description)
```

    ## # A tibble: 831 x 3
    ##    Code    `Calendar Year` Description

Tidy text format
----------------

We save the course descriptions in the [tidy text format](https://www.tidytextmining.com/tidytext.html) with one row per combination of course, year and word

``` r
d_description <- unnest_tokens(
  tbl    = d_description, 
  output = word,
  input  = Description
  )
```

``` r
print(d_description)
```

    ## # A tibble: 340,594 x 3
    ##    Code    `Calendar Year` word       
    ##    <chr>   <chr>           <chr>      
    ##  1 COR1002 2014-2015       cor1002    
    ##  2 COR1002 2014-2015       philosophy 
    ##  3 COR1002 2014-2015       of         
    ##  4 COR1002 2014-2015       science    
    ##  5 COR1002 2014-2015       course     
    ##  6 COR1002 2014-2015       coordinator
    ##  7 COR1002 2014-2015       prof       
    ##  8 COR1002 2014-2015       dr         
    ##  9 COR1002 2014-2015       l          
    ## 10 COR1002 2014-2015       boon       
    ## # ... with 340,584 more rows

Stemming and stop word removal
------------------------------

Lastly, we stem the terms and remove the stop words. We use the stemmer from the `hunspell` package to build the stemming function `stem_hunspell()` which, given a term, returns its stem. We prefer the Hunspell stemmer over the usual Snowball stemmer because it offers a more precise stemming.

> **Trick: dictionary-based approach.** Since the function `stem_hunspell()` is not vectorized, it takes a very long time to apply it to all all `340,000` terms of the data set. We therefore create a dictionary that gives the stem of the `8,500` distinct terms present in `d_description_tidy` and then join it with the original data set

``` r
# Stemming function
stem_hunspell <- function(term) {
  
  # look up term in dictionary
  stems  <- hunspell_stem(term)[[1]]    
  n_stem <- length(stems)
  
  # if no stem in dictionary, return original term
  if(n_stem == 0) return(term)
  
  # otherwise, return last one (most basic)
  else            return(stems[[n_stem]]) 
  
}


#
# Create dictionary 
my_dictionary <- d_description %>%
  
  # identify distinct words
  distinct(word) %>%
  
  # only apply `stem_hunspell` to the distinct words of the data set
  mutate(
    word_stem = purrr::map_chr(
      .x = word,
      .f = stem_hunspell
      )
    )


#
# Join dictionary and d_description
d_description <- my_dictionary %>%
  full_join(
  d_description,
  by = "word"
    ) %>%
  rename(
    word_original = word,
    word          = word_stem
    )
  

  
#  
# Remove stop words

# own stop words
own_sp <- c("student", "study")

d_description <- d_description %>%
  filter(
    # remove common stop words
    !word %in% stop_words$word,
    # remove number up ti 1,000
    !word %in% as.character(1 : 1e3),
    # remove own stop words
    !word %in% own_sp
    )


rm(stem_hunspell, my_dictionary)
```

``` r
print(d_description) # See humanities (original) - humanity (stem)
```

    ## # A tibble: 167,961 x 4

Analysis
========

Overview
--------

We conduct three analyses. First, we identify the key words of each course and cluster with the tf-idf. Next, compare the curriculum across years to identify which themes have emerged and declined. Finally, we use the LDA algorithm (a popular technique for topic modeling) to build a topic model of the 2018-2019 curriculum.

Key words
---------

The tf-idf is a popular measure to identify the most important terms of documents belonging to a corpus. By penalizing terms that occur in many documents, the tf-idf allows us to focus on the terms that are specific to each document. In our case, terms such as "learn" or "student", which appear in most course descriptions, and are therefore uninformative, have a low tf-idf. This way, we can identify the most *distinctive* terms, i.e. the key words, of each course descriptions. We use the function `tidytext::bind_tf_idf()` to obtain the tf-idf of each term for the year 2018-2019.

``` r
tf_idf <- d_description %>%
  
  # Only analyze most recent year
  filter(
    `Calendar Year` == "2018-2019"
    ) %>%
  
  # Compute tf-idf
  count(
    Code,
    word,
    sort = TRUE
    ) %>%
  bind_tf_idf(
    term = word,
    document = Code,
    n = n
    ) %>%
  
  # Join with d_course to have additional information about the courses
  left_join(
    d_course, 
    by = "Code"
    )
  

print(tf_idf)
```

``` r
tf_idf_cluster <- tf_idf %>%
  group_by(
    Cluster, 
    word
    ) %>%
  summarise(
    tf_idf = sum(tf_idf),
    n      = sum(n)
    ) %>%
  ungroup
```

### Results

The reader can visualize the results on the [Shiny App](https://rmorsomme.shinyapps.io/shiny_app/). The tf-idf does a pretty good job at identifying the key words of each course and clusters. If the title of the courses or clusters were absent from the plots, it would still be fairly easy to guess them from the key words. We also observe interesting elements at the cluster level. While the cluster `History` gives a central place to the European continent (with key words like Europe and european), the cluster `International Relations` focuses more on China (chinese).

Term Emergence
--------------

We compare the content of the curriculum across years to identify terms and themes that have declined or emerged over time. To accomplish this, we compare the frequency of the terms in two different catalogues by taking their `log odds ratio`. A positive value indicates that the term is more frequent in the latter catalogue (the term has *emerged*) and a negative value indicates a *decline* in the use of the term in the latter catalogues.

### Results

Again, the reader can visualize the results on the [Shiny App](https://rmorsomme.shinyapps.io/shiny_app/). Let us compare the years `2014-2015` (oldest available) and `2018-2019` (most recent). From the plots, we observe that topics that have made the news these last few years such as religion, migrationa and climate have gain importance in the curriculum. This shows that the college has done a good job at adapting its curriculum to the development of the world's affairs. We also observe that the themes of sexuality (with terms like `sex`, `sexual` and `sexuality`) and terrorism (`terrorism`, `crime`) have declined. It is interesting to note that the terms `globalization`, `poverty` and `sustainability` have also become less important in the curriculum. As for the term `portal`, its "emergence" is due to the introduction of a new online student *portal* system in 2016. The terms is not mentioned once in 2014-2015 and appears `19` times in 2018-2019. This shows that human interpretation and a good knowledge of the data are crucial in such analysis.

Topic Modeling
--------------

Finally, we use the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm to fit a topic model to the corpus of course descriptions. Given a corpus of documents and a predetermined number of topics, the LDA algorithm outputs a topic model which gives the importance of each term to the topics (beta distribution) and the importance of each topic to the documents (gamma distribution). In other words, the LDA finds the mixture of words associated with each topic and the mixture of topics associated with each document. The advantage of the LDA over classic clustering methods is that is allows for overlap of terms across topics and of topics across documents, thereby offering a model that is closer to natural language.

### Estimating the ideal number of topics

We use the function `ldatunning::FindTopicsNumber()` to estimate the ideal number of topics for the model. The function computes four metrics across different number of topics.

``` r
d_cast <- d_description %>%
  
  # Only analyze most recent year
  filter(
    `Calendar Year` == "2018-2019"
    ) %>%
  count(
    Code, 
    word
    ) %>%
  cast_dtm(
    Code,
    word,
    n
    )
```

``` r
#
# Parameters of Gibbs optimizer
my_control <- list(
  
  nstart  = 10,
  seed    = c(1 : 10),
  best    = TRUE,
  
  burnin  = 500,
  iter    = 2000,
  thin    = 100
  
  )


#
# Simulations
results_n_topics <- d_cast %>%
  
  FindTopicsNumber(
    
    # Number of topics tried
    topics = seq(5, 95, by = 5),
  
    # metrics considered
    metrics = c(
      "Griffiths2004",
      "CaoJuan2009",
      "Arun2010",
      "Deveaud2014"
      ),
    
    # Method for fitting LDA
    method  = "Gibbs",
    
    # Parameters of Gibbs optimizer
    control = my_control,
    
    # number of CPU cores to use
    mc.cores = 2L
  
  )
```

``` r
FindTopicsNumber_plot(results_n_topics[c(1, 3 : 5)]) # we do not include XXX because it produces NaN for some reason.
```

![](Data_Prep_and_Analysis_files/figure-markdown_github/LDA%20n%20topics%20plot-1.png)

Deveaud2014 is uninformative in our case. CaoJuan2009 and Arun2010 indicate that `30` is an appropriate number of topics for the topic model.

Let us thus create a topic model with `30` topics (`45` is also a suitable number for the sake of parsimony and because it is easier to visualize, I choose `30` topics), as well as one with `5` topics for illustration

``` r
#
# 30 topics (ideal number of topics)
LDA_30  <- LDA(
  
  x       = d_cast ,
  k       = 30      ,
  method  = "Gibbs",
  
  control = my_control
  )
```

``` r
#
# 5 topics (for illustration)
LDA_5  <- LDA(
  
  x       = d_cast ,
  k       = 5      ,
  method  = "Gibbs",
  
  control = my_control
  )
```

### Results

We present the output of a topic model with three plots which respectively show (i) the most important terms for each topic (ii) the main courses/clusters of each topic and (iii) the most important topics of each course/cluster. For each model, we present the results at the course- an the cluster-level. The LDA is an unsupervised algorithm, meaning that the topic are unlabeled. In the final section, I label the topic manually.

Let us set the number of topics to `12` and observe the plots at the cluster level. Most topics are covered by several clusters. Fot instance, `topic 10` is covered in several clusters of the humanities (`History`, `Literature` and `Philosophy`) and social sciences (`International Relations`, `International Law` and `Economics`). For a liberal arts program this is a desirable outcome since it encourages students interested in a particular topic to take classes in different clusters, thereby broading their acadmeic horizon (one of the objectives of the program). At the same time, this pattern may be artificially created by the fact that there are more than twelve topics present in the curriculum, meaning that the LDA algorithm has to combine unrelated themes into one topic. This is for instance the case for `topic 3` which combines the themes of law (`law`, `legal`) and international affairs (`european`, `international`) (see first plot). Increasing the number of topics in the model should solve this issue.

We also observe that the distribution of topics is very different at the course and the cluster level. While courses are usually heavily dominated by a single topics, clusters contain several major topics. Looking at the second plot, we observe that the courses `Computer Science`, `Optimization` and `Philosophy of Language` for instance are heavily dominated by `topic 7`. The fourth plots shows that most clusters contain several topics. Interestingly, this graph shows that the same topic (`topic 10`) dominates the clusters `History`, `International Relations` and `Literature`. This indicates either that the content of the three clusters share some similarity or that `topic 10` contains several different themes.

So far, we have only analyzed models with unlabelled topics. In order to give more substance to our analysis, we assign labels to the topics. To accomplish this, we look at the first plot showing the most important terms of each topic and attempt to identify the common theme(s) among them. Some topics are easier to label than others. `topic 6` is for instance pretty straightforward: it is dominated by the term `search` and also contain the terms `qualitative`, `read`, `interview` and `study`: `topic 6` corresponds to qualitative research skills and we therefore label it `Qual. Res.`. Labelling `topic 7` on the other hand is more trick. The best label I could find is `Engineering`. I have labelled each topic and present the results under the tab `labeled topics`.

The labels give us a better image of the actual content of the courses and the clusters. The last plot indicate thta most clusters cover the topics that we expect them to cover, indicating that the current division of courses in clusters is backed up by the content of the courses. As expected, the cluster `Sociology` covers the topics of `Society` and `Culture` and the cluster `Cultural Studies` covers the topics of `Arts`, `Culture` and `Qual. Res.`. Yet, I am surprised by the absence of certain topics in some clusters. For instance, the cluster `history` lacks the topics of `culture` and `society` and the topic of `research` is also barely present in `Biomedical Sciences`. The former shows the heavy focus of the `history` cluster on war and conflicts (`Foreign Policy`) and the latter reflects the absence of research projects in the classes of the biomedical cluster, something the college might want to investigate.
